# Chat application
## Description
A small project where I made a chat application to practicing my skills in Java for applications.

The application is done in android studio with Java.

The database is done with firebase to store all the users informations and chats.

## Installation
To install the application I have uploaded an APK for you to download to your phone and install it.
Remember that the application is only for android.

## Demonstration

## Usage
When you have installed the application on your phone (android) you can then sign up.

- It will ask you to login or create an account.
- When you creating an account it will ask you for, name, email, password, confirm password. All of them needs to be filled in. The application will tell you if you forgot to fill in any of them or if the email are in use already.
- After filling in all the information, the application will ask you for a profile picture. This step can be skipped if the user dont want to add a picture.

Now the user is created and will be auto logged in.

- On the home screen the user can see all the chats that the user have been writen in or if someone texted the user.
- The user can press the plus button to search for users. When the button is pressed I(creater) will be showed.
The user can also in this stage choose to search for a user.
Pressing the search icon will make a textfield appear and the user can type in the name of the user it searching for.

Some extra functions.

- When the user are in a chat it can see if the other person is online or not.
- When the user tabs out or close the application it will save down that the user is not logged in anymore in the database.
- When opening up the application again, will automatic log the user back in.
- If the user have tabbed down the user will receive notifications if any one text them.

If you want to try to login and not make a new account you can use:
Email: test@gmail.com
Password: test

## Improvements
