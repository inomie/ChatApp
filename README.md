# Chat application
## Description
A small project where I made a chat application to practice my skills in Java for applications.

The application is done in android studio with Java.

The database is done with firebase to store all the users informations and chats.

## Installation
To install the application I have uploaded an APK for you to download to your phone and install it.
Remember that the application is only for android.

## Demonstration

## Usage
When you have installed the application on your phone (android) you can then sign up.

- It will ask you to login or create an account.
- When you creating an account it will ask you for, name, email, password, confirm password. All of them needs to be filled in. The application will tell you if you forgot to fill in any of them or if the email are in use already.
- After filling in all the information the application will ask you for a profile picture. This step can be skipped if the user dont want to add a picture.
